# weather_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

**Homepage()**

The Homepage widget is a stateless widget that builds the main 
UI of the app. It includes a background color (instead of an image) and 
styled text using the GoogleFonts package. Here's what it contains:

*A Scaffold with a custom background color (Color(0xFF362A84)).

*Centered text displaying "Weather App" as a title.

*Typography powered by Google Fonts, e.g., using Poppins or any other chosen font.
